    "safe_problem_one": "什么是预警线？",
    "safe_problem_one_answer": "当抵押数字货币价格低于预警线价格时，会短信提醒用户，关注币价。预警线价格=用户剩余未还金额*80%/（当前抵押数字货币数量*55%）。。",
    "safe_problem_two": "什么是预处置线？",
    "safe_problem_two_answer": "当抵押数字货币价格低于预处置线价格时，会短信提醒用户，用户需在24小时内补仓或还款，如果24小时后依然低于预处置线，则用户抵押资产会被转移处置。预处置线价格=用户剩余未还⾦额*70%/（当前抵押数字货币数量*55%）",
    "safe_problem_three": " 什么是强平线？",
    "safe_problem_three_answer": "任何情况下，当抵押数字货币价格低于强平线价格时，会立即转移处置用户抵押资产。强平线价格=用户剩余未还⾦额*65%/（当前抵押数字货币数量*55%）",
    "safe_problem_four": " 如何补仓？",
    "safe_problem_four_answer": "未还的贷款，任何时候都可以进行补仓，补仓地址即是托管抵押资产的智能合约地址。当抵押资产币价低于预处置线时，用户需及时补仓建议金额，以免24小时后价格依然低于预处置线被强平。",
    "safe_problem_five": "为什么还未放款成功就提醒我补仓？",
    "safe_problem_five_answer": "当智能合约在规定时间内接收足额抵押资产后，贷款计划即生效，风控相关安全策略即开始工作，放款可能有延迟，如果这时币价低于与处置线价格，就会提醒您补仓。等待放款期间，当触发抵押资产处置线时，如果平台未开始放款，则会取消贷款计划，退还用户抵押币；如果平台已经开始放款，则会确保放款成功，可能会出现用户还未收到放款，但抵押资产已被转移处置，不用担心，平台一定会确保放款成功。",
    "safe_problem_six": "抵押币价格上涨，我能贷出来更多钱么？",
    "safe_problem_six_answer": "当前不支持，我们正在紧锣密鼓的开发此功能，很快就会上线，敬请期待。"

    "safe_problem_one": "What is an early warning line?",
    "safe_problem_one_answer": "When the price of the mortgage digital currency is lower than the price of the warning line, an SMS will be sent to remind the user to pay attention to the price of the currency. Warning line price = user remaining outstanding amount * 80% / (current mortgage digital currency amount * 55%).",
    "safe_problem_two": " What is a pre-disposal line?",
    "safe_problem_two_answer": "When the price of the mortgage digital currency is lower than the price of the pre-disposal line, an SMS will be sent to remind the user that the user needs to replenish the position or repay within 24 hours. If the pre-disposal line is still below the pre-disposal line after 24 hours, the user's mortgaged assets will be transferred and disposed. Pre-disposal line price = user remaining outstanding amount * 70% / (current mortgage digital currency amount* 55%)。",
    "safe_problem_three": " What is a forced-liquidation floor?",
    "safe_problem_three_answer": "In any case, when the price of the mortgage digital currency is lower than the price of the forced-liquidation floor, the user's mortgage assets will be transferred and disposed immediately. forced-liquidation floor price = user remaining outstanding amount * 65% / (current mortgage digital currency amount *55%)",
    "safe_problem_four": " How to replenish the position?",
    "safe_problem_four_answer": "Outstanding loans can be replenished at any time. The replenishment address is the smart contract address of the mortgaged asset. When the price of the mortgaged asset is below the pre-disposal line, the user needs to replenish the proposed amount in time to avoid forced liquidation due to the price remaining below the pre-disposal line after 24 hours.",
    "safe_problem_five": " Why reminding me replenishment before loan payment?",
    "safe_problem_five_answer": "When the smart contract receives the full amount of mortgage assets within prescribed time, the loan plan will take effect, the risk control related security strategy will start working, and the loan may be delayed. If the price of the currency at the time is lower than the pre-disposal line price, you will be reminded to replenish the position. During the period of waiting for the loan payment, when the mortgage asset disposal line is triggered, if the platform does not start giving loans, the loan plan will be cancelled and the user's mortgage currency will be refunded; if the platform has started to give loans, it is guaranteed to pay the loan but the user may not receive it while mortgage assets have been transferred and disposed. Don’t worry. The platform will ensure successful loan payment.",
    "safe_problem_six": "If the price of the mortgage currency has risen, can I lend more money?",
    "safe_problem_six_answer": "Currently not applicable. We are developing this feature intensively and will launch it online soon. Stay tuned."
